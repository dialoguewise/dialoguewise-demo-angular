This repo demonstrates on how the Dialogue Wise Api can be integrated into an Angular app.

## Integrating the API into your apps
Use the below `NPM` package to call the Api.

```
npm i dialogue-wise
```

The dependency package `jsSHA` also needs to be installed.

```
npm i jssha
```

Please refer to [app.component.ts](https://github.com/kentmz/dialoguewise-demo-angular/blob/master/src/app/app.component.ts) in the git repo which demonstrates usage of this NPM package.
